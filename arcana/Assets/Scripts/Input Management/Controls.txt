Thinking about the commands that we will need.

1. While UnityEngine allows us to use KeyCodes and the like,it's not so useful when it comes down to Gamepads.
2. In most cases, the Gamepad buttons can all be approached through the Input Manager's axis system.
3. Keyboard commands can be handled as a separate edge case.

The Commands in question.

Debug Commands 	
These are all commands that will be moved around and deactivated.	
These should all be activated by keystrokes on the keyboard.
These will be handled by manager level classes as they need to.
